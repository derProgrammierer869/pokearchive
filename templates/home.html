            <center>This page is dedicated to documenting and archiving anything related to the third generation of Pokemon.
                 This includes the games, special events for the games, the trading card game, and anything else important relating to these games. There is a lot of obscure and Japan exclusive content and merchandise out there, and the goal is to have documentation for it all in one place.</center>
